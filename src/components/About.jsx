      <p>
        Hello! Iâ€™m a passionate software engineer who completed the Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly.
        During my time there, I gained hands-on experience in building full-stack applications using modern technologies
        like React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
      </p>

        I enjoy solving real-world problems through code and have a growing portfolio of projects that reflect my dedication to clean,
        efficient, and user-focused software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of coding, I enjoy runnning and travelling with my fmaily.
