        <p>
          Hello! I’m a passionate software engineer who completed the Software Engineering Immersive at General Assembly.
          During the bootcamp, I built multiple full-stack applications using modern technologies like React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
        </p>
        <p>
          With a background in logistics and supply chain management, I enjoy applying technology to solve real-world operational challenges.
          I’m committed to writing clean, efficient, and user-focused code that makes a difference.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of coding, I love running, traveling with my family, and learning about emerging tech.
